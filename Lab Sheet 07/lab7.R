# Q1
# A train arrives at a station uniformly between 8:00 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. Let the
# random variable X represent the number of minutes the train arrives after 8:00 a.m. 
# What is the probability that the train arrives between 8:10 a.m. and 8:25 a.m.?

# We want to find P(10 < X < 25), calculated as P(X <= 25) - P(X <= 10).
punif(25, min = 0, max = 40) - punif(10, min = 0, max = 40)

# Q2
# The time (in hours) to complete a software update is exponentially distributed with rate Î» = 1/3. 
# Find the probability that an update will take at most 2 hours.

# We want to find P(X <= 2).
pexp(2, rate = 1/3)

# Q3
# Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.

# i. What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ above 130?
# We want to find P(X > 130)

pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 15, lower.tail = FALSE)

# ii. What IQ score represents the 95th percentile ?
# We need to find the value 'k' for which P(X <= k) = 0.95.

qnorm(0.95, mean = 100, sd = 15)
